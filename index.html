                    <h3>~ How is Food Club Food different to other suppliers?</h3>
                    <p> 
                        There are a few ways we are different: <br>
                        
                    1. We source directly from food producers and farms, cutting out any middle men <br>
                        
                    2. We use an innovative logistics model to get products to customers faster and fresher than other suppliers <br>
                        
                    3. We are tech-driven, half of our staff is part of the technology team, and we are building best-in-class tools to support our customers

                <div class="questions-answers two">
                    <h3>~ How is Food Club Food different to procurement consultancies?</h3>
                    <p>We own our supply chain and logistics and we take title of products at the source and handle all deliveries from the producer through to the customer. We will do the work of a typical procurement consultancy but we will do it free of charge. We only ask that, in return, you provide fair feedback on the products and the service. </p>

                <div class="questions-answers three">
                    <h3>~ How do you make your money?</h3>
                    <p>It’s free for restaurants to use our platform and benefit from our research services. We apply a fair and transparent margin on product prices, inclusive of our logistics costs and services.  Transparency is a core value of our business. </p>
